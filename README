Ring Style File Manager


This is the first software piece of my own custom operating system for my 
TouchScreen coffee table.

The idea is a ring shaped file browser, with parent nodes on the
exterior rings, and the children on the innermost ring, with the current
directory displayed in the middle.

Touching (or clicking) and dragging a ring will allow it to rotate to bring the desired folder closer and a double tap or double click will navigate into that
directory. Similarly, double tap/clicking on an outer ring takes you out to that
parent directory.

Looking to implement OpenGL or something similar to add smooth and stunning visual effects to the navigation between directories, as well as a fade in and out for opening the filesystem itself
